# About
Ohmyfood is an online food ordering company that allows user to compose their own menu and reduce waiting time in restaurants because they make their choice in advance.
# Browser Compatibility
This project was designed to deliver a seamless user experience across all devices, from mobile to desktop. This project uses HTML and CSS written using Sass to ensure the code is easy to read and maintainable. To create a dynamic user experience, I employed animations and transitions to give feedback on user interactions such as selecting dishes and presenting menu cards. Additionally, I implemented a loading spinner to provide visual feedback when loading content. By using a mobile-first approach, the design is tailored for the smallest screens first, and then adjusted for larger screens.
# Deliverables

Footer - identical on all pages<br />

Menu pages (x4) - Dishes appear gradually with a slight time lag and an animation shows when selecting each dish<br />
Buttons - showing drop shadows and changing color - heart-shaped Like button with effect<br />
Graphic effects and animations using CSS animations or transitions<br />
